Planned changes

▪️ Obtaining a list of business places for all goods groups

Goods groups affected:

# All goods groups

Business context

Obtaining details of the business places that are registered in the marking system will become available for all goods groups. This is especially important for diversified companies with a large number of business places.

You will now be able to obtain up-to-date information about all business places — both for a specific goods group, and for all goods groups simultaneously, including addresses, KPPs or FIAS identifiers, as well as the EGAIS blocking statuses. This will not only simplify the integration with internal accounting systems, but also improve the efficiency of data management.

True API changes:

$ The method to be modified: Method of receiving a list of the goods circulation participant’s business places

Details:

The following will be added into the “Method of receiving a list of the goods circulation participant’s business places”:

# optional request string parameter of array of strings type%—%productGroups (List of goods groups). Possible values: names of the goods groups from the "Catalog - List of supported goods groups” (e.g.: beer).

If this parameter is not specified, business places will be returned in the response for all goods groups.

If there are no business places for the goods groups specified, the response will return an empty array of objects result (List of business places);

# mandatory response parameter of array of strings type%—%productGroups (List of goods groups).

For the description of the method and “Catalog - List of supported goods groups”, see True API document (it is published in a user account on the production environment and in the knowledge base of the “Integrators Register”).

▪️ Obtaining details of a business place where identification means has been applied

Goods groups affected:

# All goods groups

Business context

Upon implementation of the new feature, you will be able to find out at which business place (the BP) the identification means (the IM) has been applied. Previously, API responses did not include this information, complicating logistics process audits.

Now the system will automatically include BP data (KPP, FIAS identifier, address) when requesting information about identification codes (IC) through the Method of receiving publicly available information on identification codes by list.

This will make it easier to identify the IM application points and enhance transparency in the goods identification process.

True API changes:

$ The method to be modified: Method of receiving publicly available information on identification codes by list

Details:

The following response parameters will be added into the Method of receiving publicly available information on identification codes by list:

▪️ Reduction of remaining items (volume and grade accounting) for seafood

Goods groups affected:

# Seafood (21 / seafood)

Business context

For the seafood goods group, the ability to adjust remaining items (for quantity reduction) will become available.

True API changes:

$ The document to be modified: “Withdrawal from circulation (volume and grade accounting)” (LK_GTIN_RECEIPT)

Details:

A new withdrawal reason%—%“Correction of remaining items (volume and grade accounting)” (BALANCE_CORRECTION) will be added for the seafood goods group in the “Withdrawal from circulation (volume and grade accounting)” document (LK_GTIN_RECEIPT).

For the description of the document, see True API documentation (it is published in a user account on the production environment and in the knowledge base of the “Integrators Register”).



▪️ Completion of marking of remaining items of medical products (medical gloves and technical rehabilitation aids)

Goods groups affected:

# Medical products (10 / wheelchairs)

Business context

Marking of remaining items will be unavailable for the medical gloves and technical rehabilitation aids from September 1, 2025.

True API changes:

& Document to be disabled: “Introduction into circulation. Remaining items” (LP_INTRODUCE_OST)

Details:

Ordering the marking codes will be unavailable for the medical products (medical gloves and technical rehabilitation aids) that have a method of release of goods into circulation%—%“Marking of remaining items”; submission of the “Introduction into circulation. Remaining items” document (LP_INTRODUCE_OST) will be unavailable as well.

For description of the document, see True API documentation (it is published in a user account on the production environment and in the knowledge base of the “Integrators Register”).



▪️ Import of engine oils via FCS and use of ACC

Goods groups affected:

# Engine oils (43 / autofluids)

Business context

Starting September 1, 2025, marking of the engine oils will be mandatory. As a result, goods imported from non-EEU countries will have to be introduced into circulation via FCS. To support this, the “Introduction into Circulation. Import with FCS” document (LP_FTS_INTRODUCE) will become available.

At the same time, the “Introduction into circulation. Manufacturing outside of EEU” document (LP_GOODS_IMPORT), which is used to introduce goods into circulation without FCS, will be discontinued as of December 1, 2025. Up to this date, this document may only be used for the goods purchased on and before August 31, 2025 and released by the customs authorities after September 1, 2025.

When importing goods via FCS, you also will be able to use the aggregated customs code (the

ACC) — a virtual package that includes identification codes of the units of goods and aggregates. Using the ACC will simplify customs procedures and interaction with the marking system. Indication of only the ACC in the customs declaration and in the document of introduction into circulation will be sufficient. There will be no need to list all individual identification codes. To work with the ACC, the following documents will be available: “ACC aggregation” (ATK_AGGREGATION), “ACC transformation” (ATK_TRANSFORMATION), “ACC disaggregation” (ATK_DISAGGREGATION).

True API changes:

’ Documents to be available:

# “Introduction into Circulation. Import with FCS” (LP_FTS_INTRODUCE)

# “ACC aggregation” (ATK_AGGREGATION)

# “ACC transformation” (ATK_TRANSFORMATION)

# “ACC disaggregation” (ATK_DISAGGREGATION)

& Document to be discontinued: “Introduction into circulation. Manufacturing outside of EEU” (LP_GOODS_IMPORT)

Details:

Distinctive features that are planned to be implemented:

# indication of the identification code that has the UNIT (Unit of goods (IC)), GROUP (Group package (GPIC)), SET (Set (SIC)), BOX (Shipping package (SPIC)) package type will be available in the “ki” parameter (“Code”) in the “ACC aggregation” (ATK_AGGREGATION) and “ACC transformation” (ATK_TRANSFORMATION) documents.

# document submission will be supported only in * .json format.

For the description of the document types, see True API documentation (it is published in a user account on the production environment and in the knowledge base of the “Integrators Register”).



▪️ Remarking of engine oils

Goods groups affected:

# Engine oils (43 / autofluids)

Business context

You will be able to remark goods of the engine oils goods group; upon remarking, the existing marking code (Data Matrix) is replaced with a new one. Remarking is required when the goods parameters do not correspond to those that are specified in a goods card in the National catalog, as well as if existing marking code is lost or damaged. A new marking code received after remarking will allow to continue sale of goods.

True API changes:

’ Document to be available: “Remarking” (LK_REMARK)

Details:

The “Remarking” document (LK_REMARK) will be available with the ability to indicate the following reasons:

# “KM_SPOILED” (“IM with MC spoiled or lost”);

# “DESCRIPTION_ERRORS” (“Errors in goods description found”).

Submission of the document will be available for the codes that have the “REAPPLY” emission type (“Marking outside of production or import”) in * .json format.

For the description of the document type, see True API documentation (it is published in a user account on the production environment and in the knowledge base of the “Integrators Register”).



▪️ Verification of license availability for cross-border import of veterinary medicines

Goods groups affected:

# Veterinary medicines (26 / vetpharma)

True API changes:

$ Modifications in the document: “Acceptance of shipment from EEU” (LP_ACCEPT_GOODS) in response to the “Shipment from EEU” document (LP_SHIP_GOODS_CROSSBORDER)

Business context

Verification of the license will be enabled for the veterinary medicines goods group in the “Acceptance” document (LP_ACCEPT_GOODS) submitted in response to the “Shipment from EEU” document (LP_SHIP_GOODS_CROSSBORDER).

A valid license with the name “Wholesale trade of medicines for veterinary use” shall be registered in the Rosselkhoznadzor registry, otherwise the document processing will fail.

For description of the documents, see True API documentation (it is published in a user account on the production environment and in the knowledge base of the “Integrators Register”).



▪️ Disabling the “Write-off (“Tobacco products”)” method

Goods groups affected:

# Tobacco products (3 / tobacco)

Business context

Disabling of the deprecated method discontinued in September 2023.

True API changes:

& Write-off (“Tobacco products”) method will be disabled

Details:

Disabling of the method is planned for November 2025. Instead, it is recommended to use the “Write-off (general document)” document (WRITE_OFF) that can be submitted via a single method of creation of the documents.

For description of the methods and document types, see True API documentation (it is published in a user account on the production environment and in the knowledge base of the “Integrators Register”).



▪️ Shipment of dairy products to the Republic of Armenia and the Republic of Belarus

▪️ Water imports from the Republic of Armenia in aggregates

Goods groups affected:

# Packaged water (13 / water)

Business context

Within the framework of mutual recognition of the identification codes, you will be able to import water from the Republic of Armenia in aggregates. This means that you can now import aggregates (group and shipping packages) that have already contained units of goods or other aggregates.

▪️ Import of medical products from the Republic of Belarus

Goods groups affected:

# Medical products (10 / wheelchairs)

Business context

It is planned to implement a simplified import of the medical products from the Republic of Belarus to the Russian Federation. An exporter will be able to obtain marking codes and formalize shipment of the goods independently via the Marking system of the Republic of Belarus.

Simplified import process will be implemented as follows:

An exporter from the Republic of Belarus describes a goods item in the National catalog and orders Russian marking codes via the Marking system of the Republic of Belarus.

The exporter applies marking codes onto goods and submits information about cross-border movement of goods to the Marking system of the Republic of Belarus. You can find these data in the Marking system of the Russian Federation in the “Shipment from EEU” document (LP_SHIP_GOODS_CROSSBORDER).

An importer submits the “Acceptance” document (LP_ACCEPT_GOODS) that contains information on the acceptance of goods specified in the shipment document to the Marking system of the Russian Federation. After successful processing of the acceptance document, the accepted codes will be introduced into circulation.

True API changes:

’ Document to be opened: “Acceptance of shipment from EEU” (LP_ACCEPT_GOODS) in response to the “Shipment from EEU” document (LP_SHIP_GOODS_CROSSBORDER)

Details:

The “Acceptance of the shipment from EEU member states” document (LP_ACCEPT_GOODS) submitted in response to the “Shipment from EEU” document (LP_SHIP_GOODS_CROSSBORDER) will be available when dealing with the Republic of Belarus. For description of the document type, see True API document.

▪️ Disabling the write-off documents

Goods groups affected:

# All goods groups

Business context

The write-off documents will be disabled. This change aims to standardize the goods write-off processes and encourages the use of a single universal document “Write-off (general document)” document (WRITE_OFF).

True API changes:

& Document to be disabled: “Write-off” (LK_KM_CANCELLATION)%—%for all goods groups except for products made of real fur (14 / furs)

										& 	Document 	to 	be 	disabled: 	“Write-off 	(for 	subsequent 	remarking)”

(LK_APPLIED_KM_CANCELLATION)%—%for all goods groups

Details:

Disabling the ability to submit documents is planned for November 2025. We recommend you to change integration solutions in advance in order to use the “Write-off (general document)” document (WRITE_OFF). The document supports write-off reasons that are similar to those used in the write-off documents to be disabled. And more statuses, in which it is possible to write off codes, are available in the document.

For description of the document types, see True API document (it is published in a user account on the production environment and in the knowledge base of the “Integrators Register”).



▪️ Mandatory indication of licenses for water

Goods groups affected:

# Packaged water (11 / water)

True API changes:

$ Modifications in the document: “Introduction into circulation. Manufacturing in the Russian

Federation” (LP_INTRODUCE_GOODS, LP_INTRODUCE_GOODS_CSV, LP_INTRODUCE_GOODS_XML)

$ Modifications in the document: “Introduction into circulation. Contract manufacturing” (LK_CONTRACT_COMMISSIONING, LK_CONTRACT_COMMISSIONING_XML)

Details:

If the groundwaterUtilization attribute (Is not obtained from underground sources) is unfilled in a goods card in the National catalog, the licences array (Array of subsoil licenses) with the licence_number (Number of subsoil license) and licence_date (License issue date) parameters will be mandatory.

At the same time if an aggregate is specified in the documents, the groundwaterUtilization attribute will be checked for the goods that are nested into the aggregate.

If groundwaterUtilization = Yes, information about a license will be optional.

For description of the document types, see True API document (it is published in a user account on the production environment and in the knowledge base of the “Integrators Register”).



▪️ Improvement of the method of receiving information on goods item by goods GTIN (v4)

Goods groups affected:

# All goods groups

True API changes:

$ Modified method: Method of receiving information on goods item by goods GTIN of

version v4.

Details:

The Method of receiving information on goods item by goods GTIN of version v4 is being improved:

# The logic of issue of information for the GTIN attributes will be changed. To date, information is returned only on the codes in the goods cards of which values of the goodTurnFlag (Indicator of goods readiness to the circulation) and goodMarkFlag (Indicator of readiness to the marking) attributes equal true. In a new version information about goods will be returned regardless of these attributes.

# A new response parameter - attributes (Object of strings with data about attributes) will be added. This parameter will contain information that describes goods from the NCMG:
