ANNOUNCEMENT OF PLANNED CHANGES IN OMS API 

This section provides a list of planned modifications (which are at the stage of analysis) in the OMS API. 

It is planned to disable support of the attached signature. Dates for disabling will be announced later.  

For the aggregation report for all goods groups a limit is imposed on the number of identification codes or shipping packages specified in the array of the aggregated codes in the “sntins” array - no more than 30, 000 identification codes.    

It is planned to make available marking of the remaining items for the “Engine oils” goods group from June 1, 2025 to October 31, 2025.  

In an order structure in the “Method of goods release into circulation” parameter:  

 a new allowed value (releaseMethodType = REMAINS (Remains marking)) will be added for the goods group;  

 a new conditionally mandatory parameter - “producer” (“INN of the goods card owner”) will be added.  

Marking of the remaining items will be available for the original gtin (local range - 046 or global – not belonging to ranges 046 and 029) if a goods circulation participant is not the goods card owner or does not have access through the sub-account. In this case, INN of the goods card owner should be specified in a request structure in the “producer” parameter for the global range. 

Emission with a method of introduction into circulation releaseMethodType = REMAINS (Marking of remaining items) is unavailable for the sets. 

Emission of the marking codes for cards with a short set of attributes (short remaining items - range 029) will be available to the “Clothing items, bed, table, bath and kitchen linens” goods group within the current marking of the remaining items.    

It is planned to launch a new goods group - “Radio electronic products. Electronic nicotine delivery systems” (API V3):  

a. An attributes set of the order will contain the “Order” basic object, including the “Order” object extension.  

The “cisType” parameter (Marking code type) of the “OrderProduct” object supports UNIT, GROUP, SET allowed values; 

The “releaseMethodType” parameter (Method of Goods Release into Circulation) which is transferred in the “attributes” attribute of the 

“Order” object supports the PRODUCTION (Manufacture in the 

Russian Federation) and IMPORT (Imported into the Russian 

Federation) allowed values; 

An attributes set of the application report will contain the basic “UtilisationReport”. The “productionDate” optional attribute (Production date – supported format is yyyy-MM-dd) can be specified in an object extension. 

Two templates of the marking codes can be used for the MC emission:  

GS1_AISTR_SHORT - AI01 14 AI21 6 <GS> AI93 4 

GS1_AISTR_ASYM_SHORT - AI01 14 AI21 13 <GS> AI91 4 <GS> AI92 44. 

It is planned to change the “Order” object in the “Create marking code emission order” method for the “Tobacco products” goods group in terms of changing mandatory of the “releaseMethodType” (“Method of Goods Release into Circulation”) parameter. From August 1, 2025, this parameter will become mandatory (OMS API V3). 

The current version of the draft resolution provides for the temporary restriction on issuance and receipt of the marking codes of the “Games and toys for children” goods group in the OMS for the goods circulation participants — tentatively until September 1, 2025. 

It is planned to change a format of the shipping package code (SSCC - length of 20 numeric symbols with GS1 AI 00 application identifier) in an aggregation report for all goods groups, except for the “Alternative tobacco products”, “Nicotine products” and “Tobacco products”. If you submit the SSCC of 18 numeric symbols without an identifier, the integrations must be finalized to reach the target version by December 

1, 2025, with the AI application identifier (00) indicated at the beginning of the code. 

As of March 1, 2025, marking of the remaining items has been unavailable for the “Medical products” goods group for the goods of the third and fifth fee implementation waves. Active orders containing goods of these fee implementation waves will be closed, and unused marking codes will be automatically annuled.  

For the “Radio-electronic products” goods group the length of the second data group in the marking code (that contains an individual serial number of the unit of goods) is planned to be increased from 13 characters to 20 characters. The marking codes issued with 13-character serial numbers will be annulled and support for these codes will be discontinued in the application report. These changes are being implemented in accordance with the Draft Rules for Marking Specific Types of Radio-electronic Products and relate to the list of radio-electronic products pertaining to all three stages of the experiment. A date for implementing these structural changes and annuling the marking codes will be announced later. 

For the “Radio-electronic products” goods group, it is planned to complete the experiment for the third fee implementation wave in accordance with the Decree of the Government of the Russian Federation of November 25, 2023, No. 1993, “On conducting an experiment on the territory of the Russian Federation on marking of individual types of radio-electronic products with identification means”, the experiment on marking of individual types of radio-electronic products with identification means in Stage III will be completed on August 31, 2025. Active orders that contain goods of the third fee implementation wave will be closed, unused marking codes will be automatically annuled.
